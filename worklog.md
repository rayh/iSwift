# TODO

## Segregate Swift project dir from the repo root

This will stop the build process from mistakenly capturing all changes
in this repo

## Integrate tensorflow

Plan:

1. base Dockerfile on tensorflow-notebook
2. Use instructions at
   https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md to
   grab swift-tensorflow instead of plain old swift
3. etc
